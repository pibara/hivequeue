# hivequeue
A txjsonrpcqueue inspired async python client library for the HIVE JSON-RPC API.

This python library is based on the txjsonrpcqueue library. While txjsonrpcqueue wasn't completely STEEM specific, its primary target platform was STEEM. As you might know, STEEM has been severely compromized by a decentralization attack. As a developer I don't want to support this compromizes blockchain, and keeping txjsonrpcqueue would mean I will do just that. I'm starting hivequeue from scratch with the explicit goal of creating an asynchonous python library for HIVE that doesn't support STEEM. I'm adding an extra clause to the copyright notice of this new library stating that hivequeue may not legally be forked to code that supports either the STEEM or TRX blockchain.
